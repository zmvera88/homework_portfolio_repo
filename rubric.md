# FEWD Week #1 Project: HTML/CSS Basics

---


### Description


For the first assignment, you will begin creating the beginnings of your first website. Take what you've learned from class and build a portfolio site that showcases all of the projects you'll be completing over the next few weeks. Build two pages - an 'About Page' and a 'Portfolio' - that link to one another. Your 'About Page' should describe your mission and value proposition and your 'Portfolio' should include descriptions of the work you [will] do for Relaxr, Startup Matchmaker, and CitiPix.
